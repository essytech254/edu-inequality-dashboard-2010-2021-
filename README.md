 #  GLOBAL EDUCATION INEQUALITY DASHBOARD (2010-2021)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global educational inequality trends from 2010 to 2021, Using a dataset from Kaggle, the dashboard provides insights into how inequality varies by
region, year, and human development group. It aims to support SDG 4 initiatives by helping researchers and investors identify disparities and target improvement areas.

## Questions answered by the dashboard:
- Percentage of inequality in education across years and top 5 developing regions.
- Relationship between educational inequality and HDI Rank (2021) in different regions.
- Trends in average educational inequality over the last decade.
- Areas with the highest levels of inequality in education.
- Regional and human development group breakdowns.
  
##  Tools and Technologies Used
-  **Power query**: Data cleaning and preparations
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: Data cleaning and preparation.
- **Data Source**: Kaggle dataset on educational inequality.
- **Git**: Version control and project management.

## Insights
-  Educational inequality is highest in developing regions.
-  Human development groups significantly impact education trends.
-  Trends over the last decade indicate progress in certain regions but stagnation in others.

## Recommendations
- Invest more in underdeveloped regions to reduce inequality.
- Focus on policies that improve HDI rankings through education.
- Develop partnerships to fund education for vulnerable groups.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. Open the Power BI file (Global_education_inequality Analysis.pbix) in Power BI Desktop.
2. Explore the visuals to gain insights on education inequality.
3. Use slicers to filter data by year, region, or development group.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more data from other SDG indicators.
- Develop predictive models for inequality trends.
- Include interactive storytelling features.
